React.js on the Play Framework
==============================

* JDK8 shipped with a JavaScript runtime: [Nashorn](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/nashorn/)
* React JS supports server side rendering via
  [`React.renderComponentToString`](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html#react.rendercomponenttostring).
* The [Play Framework](http://playframework.com/) is a web framework that runs
  on the JVM

With these powers combined, Play can use the same JavaScript sent to the client
to render its templates on the server.

## To try it out:

1. Clone this repository
2. Follow the instructions to install and
   [get started with Play 2.2+](http://playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/Home)
3. Run the app with `play run`
4. View [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/) in your browser

### What am I looking at?

This app is using the JavaScript from my
[React Reddit Client](https://github.com/ssorallen/react-reddit-client) but with
one key, huge, fantastic change: the first view you see is rendered on the
server.
